This function simply turns the orientation and position
of our physics node into a transformation matrix, suitable
for plugging into our Renderer!

It is cleaner to work with matrices when it comes to rendering,
as it is what shaders expect, and allow us to keep all of our
transforms together in a single construct. But when it comes to
physics processing and 'game-side' logic, it is much neater to
have seperate orientations and positions.
